# 42
**My school projects during my studies at 42 Lausanne coding school**

Generally I tend to not look in the code of other students before I write my project so it'll be wrriten in my way with my own ideas and structure.
That may the reason you will encounter some code that could be wrriten in a better / shorter way (let's not forget I started my school with no experience at all).

My guidline will alwyas be to write the project in a simple and reliable way that is clear to understand and troubleshoot and strives to cover 100% of the cases.
